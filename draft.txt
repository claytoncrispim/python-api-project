### What's New?

* **A `ContactForm` Model:** This new class defines the three fields we expect: `name`, `email`, and `message`.
* **Email Validation (`EmailStr`):** Notice we used a special type, `EmailStr`, for the email field. FastAPI will now automatically reject any request where the email is not in a valid format (e.g., `test@example.com`). This is incredibly powerful!
* **A `/contact` Endpoint:** A new endpoint specifically for handling our contact form data.

### Test Your New Contact Form API

Your server has already reloaded!

1.  Refresh your documentation page at **`http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`**.
2.  You will now see a **third** endpoint: `POST /contact`.
3.  Click on it, click "Try it out," and in the request body, enter a full contact form object:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "Clayton",
      "email": "clayton.is.a.legend@example.com",
      "message": "FastAPI is amazing!"
    }
